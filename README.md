# causal_snow_proj

GitHub Repository for code to run CCM analysis on HPC cluster.
Main analysis featured on manuscript are located in `analysis`

The CCMs were done using the following

Tau: 3 [1, 3, 6]

FOR SST:
- lat: 41
- lon: 51
- Total Runs: 41\*51\*3 = 6273 


SLP runs were initially conducted and the code has been made available. However,
we did not use this analysis in our manuscript and focused on the SST analysis.

This repository is attempting to follow the guidelines for GRRIEn repository and code.
